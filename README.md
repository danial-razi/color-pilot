**A minimal, offline-first color palette generator that extracts beautiful color schemes from images and CSS code. Designed for developers and designers to quickly capture and save inspiration.**

## Installing as a PWA (Recommended)

ColorPilot is built to run best as an installed Progressive Web App.

1. Open the live site in Chrome, Edge, Safari, or another PWA-capable browser.
2. Use the browser’s “Install” / “Add to Home Screen” option (usually in the address bar or menu).
3. Launch the installed app from your desktop, Start menu, or mobile home screen.
4. The app works offline after the first visit and updates automatically whenever a new version is published.

If you’re testing locally:
```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run preview
```
Then open the preview URL and install the app the same way.
